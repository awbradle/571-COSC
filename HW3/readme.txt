To execute queries, you must have the sqlite-jdbc-3.8.11.2.jar file in the folder
as the compiled Java file

Design Issues: None really. I could have formatted the line with the SQL Query string
on it better in the code. This was more a tedious exercise of getting all the columns
to line up correctly. I assumed that returned null values where a city does not have any
employees would be interpreted at 0 for integers and it seems this is the case.
